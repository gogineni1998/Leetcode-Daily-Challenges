Sure, let's break down the code and explain its functionality along with the time complexity of each part.

### Explanation of the Solution Class:

#### `getPrimes` Method:
- This method generates prime numbers up to a given number `num` and stores them in the `primes` list.
- It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find prime numbers.
- Time Complexity: O(n log log n), where n is the value of `num`.

#### `canTraverseAllPairs` Method:
- This method checks whether all pairs of numbers in the `nums` array can be traversed.
- It initializes a `map` to store prime factors of numbers, a `primes` list to store prime numbers, and finds the maximum number in `nums`.
- Then, it calculates the square root of the maximum number to limit the range for finding primes.
- Next, it populates the `map` with prime factors of each number in `nums`.
- Finally, it checks if all numbers in `nums` belong to the same disjoint set using the `DisJointSet` class.
- Time Complexity: O(n log log n + k), where n is the length of `nums` and k is the number of distinct prime factors of the numbers in `nums`.

### Explanation of the DisJointSet Class:

#### Constructor:
- Initializes `parent` and `rank` lists for disjoint set operations.
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes.

#### `getUltimateParent` Method:
- Finds the ultimate parent (representative) of a node using path compression.
- Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of nodes.

#### `addEdge` Method:
- Joins two disjoint sets by their ultimate parents based on rank.
- Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of nodes.

### Overall Time Complexity:
- The overall time complexity of the `canTraverseAllPairs` method depends on the time complexity of `getPrimes` and the disjoint set operations.
- Assuming `getPrimes` dominates, the overall time complexity is O(n log log n), where n is the maximum number in the `nums` array.

This analysis provides an understanding of how the code works and estimates its performance under different scenarios.
