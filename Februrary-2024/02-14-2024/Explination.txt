This Java code defines a class `Solution` with a method `rearrangeArray` that takes an array of integers `nums` as input and rearranges it such that positive numbers appear before negative numbers while maintaining the order of both positive and negative numbers within their respective groups.

Let's break down the code and its complexity:

1. **Initialization**: The code initializes two ArrayLists, `positive` and `negative`, to hold positive and negative numbers from the input array, respectively. It also initializes an integer array `result` to store the rearranged array, with the same length as the input array.

2. **Iteration through the input array**: The code iterates through the input array `nums`. For each element, if it's positive, it adds it to the `positive` list, otherwise to the `negative` list.

3. **Merging positive and negative numbers**: After segregating positive and negative numbers, the code initializes variables `i` and `j` to track indices of the positive and negative lists, respectively. It also initializes an index variable `ind` to track the current index of the `result` array. Then, it iterates through both lists, alternately adding elements from each list into the `result` array until one of the lists is exhausted.

4. **Adding remaining elements**: After merging, if any elements remain in either the `positive` or `negative` list, the code adds them to the `result` array.

5. **Return**: Finally, the code returns the rearranged array `result`.

**Time Complexity Analysis**:

- Iterating through the input array: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.
- Merging positive and negative numbers: Since each positive and negative number is added to the `result` array exactly once, the time complexity for this step is O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
- Adding remaining elements: If there are m positive and k negative numbers, the time complexity for adding remaining elements is O(m + k), but since m + k <= n (total number of elements), it's also O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
