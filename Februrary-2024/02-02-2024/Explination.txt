as you see the difference between and two valid numbers is 1111..(based on the number size)

calculate the first valid number and than the process continumes from then on by adding 1111...

time complexcity O(9 + 9 + 90) = O(180) = O(1)

space complexcity O(1)

-- clean code explination --

add 1 to 9 in queue

pop and add 1*10 + (1 + 1) until the value is less than high
